# Testing HOPR

Testing peer-to-peer technologies can often be a challenging task. As the **HOPR Network** is distributed, software releases that the HOPR Association team releases might work in one part of the globe on a given configuration, but fail in another one under a different network setting.

## Incentivized Network

To help us testing HOPR, the HOPR Association team is constantly running _Incentivized Networks_, where users all over the world run **HOPR Nodes** in exchange of having a chance to obtain rewards in the form of **HOPR Tokens.** Doing so requires users to register with a Twitter account and staking a minimal amount of digital tokens in their **HOPR Nodes.** After a successful resgitration, the nodes are meant to stay online to _Cover traffic_ across the network, while submitting bugs and other anominal behaviour from the network.

## Releases Checklists

The HOPR Association team also conducts releases checklists, where we provide a breakdown of each version performance on minimal tasks as executed by team members, ambassadors, and/or other members of the community. The goal is to provide a trail of features that had been proven to work at some point of time, as to avoid functional regressions usual normal unit or integration tests can not pick up. As these tests are conducted by different individuals in various settings, we are able to identify behaviour that is unexpected on every minor release.
